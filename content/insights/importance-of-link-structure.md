When it comes to optimizing a website for search engines and improving the user 
experience, link structure is a crucial element to consider. In this article, we'll 
discuss why having a well-structured link is important for both SEO and your 
audience as they search as well as how category landing pages can help visitors with 
ease of navigation.   

## Why link structure is helpful for SEO  :key:     


Link structure is important for SEO since search engines use URLs to crawl 
and understand the structure of a website. A well-structured link hierarchy can 
help search engines understand the relative importance of pages on a website and 
help them crawl the site more efficiently. Improved link structure and logic in 
URL links can improve the visibility of a website in search engine results by using 
relevant keywords that a user might search with.  

Link structure in the tone of a client is also valuable for visitors because 
it can help them navigate the website more easily based on words that they're 
using to search with.     

> A clear and intuitive link hierarchy can make it convenient 
for users to find the information they are looking for on a website.   

If a visitor finds navigation more convenient then this can improve user experience 
and increase the likelihood that users will stay on the website and return in 
the future.   

## How do link structures factor into a search engine's indexing?  :question:  

**A well-structured link hierarchy can help search engines understand the relative 
importance of pages on a website.** A search engine might use links as a way to crawl and 
categorize the content on a website. When a search engine crawls a website, it 
follows the links on a page to discover new content and determine how it's related 
to the rest of the site. For more information, please see our post about [how search 
engines categorize content when indexing]({{<ref "/insights/search-engine-categorization">}} "Search Engine Categorization")  
 

Having a clear and intuitive link structure, where links are organized in a logical way, 
can help search engines understand the relationship between different pages on a website.   
> For example, if a website has a clear category hierarchy, with main categories linking 
to subcategories and individual pages, it can help search engines understand the 
organization of the site.   

This can improve the accuracy of search engine results, as they will be able to 
understand the context of a page, and therefore return more relevant results to 
the user.  

Furthermore, having a clear link structure can also help search engines determine 
which pages on a website are the most important. Pages that are linked to more 
frequently are often considered more important than those that are linked to less 
frequently.   


## How link structure is useful for visitors :mag_right:  

In addition to helping with SEO, link structure is also valuable for visitors. 
A clear and intuitive link hierarchy can make it easier for users to find the 
information they are looking for on a website. This can improve the user experience 
and increase the likelihood that users will stay on the website and return in the 
future.  

One way to improve link structure and ease of navigation for visitors is by 
using category landing pages. These are pages that serve as an overview for 
a specific category of content on a website. For example, a website 
selling clothing might have a category landing page for "men's clothing"  

## Final thoughts  

The link structure of a website plays a crucial role in the way search engines 
 crawl, categorize and understand the content of a website, which ultimately 
 improves the accuracy of search engine results and user satisfaction. If you're
