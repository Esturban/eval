## Intro to Web  
The Internet is a vast place where it's hard to get noticed. 
In this article, we will go through the importance of a well-maintained website to help you get the most value 
from your digital presence.

A website is the first thing that people see when they are looking for you online and you have just what they're looking for. 
It's a chance to make an impression and a poor site could leave one you don't want when a user wanted to make a purchase. 
A bad impression can take the form of:  
- Long wait times  
- Poor navigation or menus  
- Dysfunctional buttons or interface (such as broken links)  
- Typography that is difficult to read or understand     

Without optimizing your website, your conversion can suffer, drive fewer customer acquisition opportunities, and increase your cost to acquire a new client.  

### Asset Review   
The first step for optimizing your website is an asset review. This means going over all of your content on the site and checking for outdated or irrelevant information that could be causing visitors to click away from your site or bounce back quickly after arriving on it.
