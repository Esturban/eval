Search engine ads, also known as pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, can be a
powerful tool for driving business online, regardless of the size of your company,
if you're looking to increase visibility and drive more traffic to a website.
Here are a few key benefits of using search engine ads:   

- **Quick results:** Unlike traditional SEO efforts, which can take weeks or even
months to show results, search engine ads can start driving traffic to your
site almost immediately. This makes them an ideal option for businesses looking
to quickly boost visibility and generate leads.  

- **Targeted audience:** With search engine ads, you can target specific keywords
and demographics, ensuring that your ads are seen by the people most likely to
be interested in your products or services. This can help increase the chances
of generating conversions and sales.  

- **Cost-effective:** Search engine ads are often less expensive than traditional
forms of advertising, such as TV or print ads. You only pay when someone
clicks on your ad, so you're not wasting money on impressions that don't
result in any action.  

- **Measurable:** Search engine ads come with detailed analytics, so you can
track the performance of your campaigns, identify which keywords and ad groups
are performing well, and make adjustments to improve reach and conversion.  

- **Local targeting:** You can target your ads to a specific geographical area,
which is particularly helpful for small businesses looking to attract customers
within a certain radius.  

- **Flexibility:** With search engine ads, you can make changes to your campaigns
at any time, and you can pause or stop your ads whenever you want. This flexibility
allows you to adjust your advertising strategy as needed and make the most of your
budget.  

These are a few of the important benefits of search engine advertising. But the
real question remains...  

> How do I, as a company, get the most of search engine advertising so that
prospects who visit my website are likely to convert?    


## :information: **Important**: How do audiences search for anything online?    

If someone is searching for something online -- a product, service or answer --
they tend to go about it with a few general formulas that allow them to find
what they are looking for.  Search engines are commonly fed terms and phrases like:  
- the name of the product or service  
- keywords related to the product or service  
- the type of product or service (such as "reviews," "prices," "compare," etc.)  
- the name of the brand or manufacturer  
- location-based terms (such as "near me" or the name of a city or region)  
- modifier terms (such as "best," "cheap," "top," "quality," etc.)  
- generic terms (such as "buy," "shop," "find," etc.)  

Instead of relying on what you can think of and how *YOU* might search for your site,
think in terms of how your audience might look for your pages. A user-oriented approach
in PPC is among the most helpful ways to ensure you're finding your target customers
who are most likely to convert and less likely to run up your advertising spend
without tangible results to justify campaigns.  

## Examples of common searches people use online     

Methods are helpful, but examples of common searches are valuable to get a better
picture of exactly how the searches are made. Here is a list of formula searches
accompanied by examples someone would make online in a search engine:  
- "buy [product name]" (e.g. "buy iPhone 12")  
- "best [product name] [modifier]" (e.g. "best running shoes for flat feet")  
- "compare [product name] [product name]" (e.g. "compare Samsung Galaxy S20 vs iPhone 12")  
- "find [product name] [location]" (e.g. "find a plumber in San Francisco")  
- "reviews [product name]" (e.g. "reviews for the Roomba i7+")  
- "cheap [product name]" (e.g. "cheap gaming laptops")  
- "top [product name] [modifier]" (e.g. "top rated laptops for students")  
- "discount [product name]" (e.g. "discount on MacBook Pro ")  
- "near me [product name]" (e.g. "best Chinese restaurants near me")  
- "price of [product name]" (e.g. "price of Tesla Model 3")  
- "brand [product name]" (e.g. "Brand Samsung TV")  
- "coupons [product name]" (e.g. "coupons for Subway sandwiches")  

This is not an exhaustive list and there are way, way more variations to
consider in the process. In the event you have issues with inspiration as to
