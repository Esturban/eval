In our previous series, [we looked at the benefits of Search Advertising over Display Advertising and when to use search marketing]({{<relref "insights/comparison-search-ads-vs-display-ads">}}). In this article we will explore 7 benefits that exist in display advertising in favour over search advertising.  

## 1.  Branding   
Display advertising is effective for branding as it allows advertisers to reach a large audience with their message by driving impressions. Advertisers can choose to display their ads on high-traffic websites, which increases the chances of their ads being seen by potential customers to ultimately share what you offer to prospects who may not be aware that your brand exists.  Search advertising, on the other hand, primarily aims to drive conversions, which may not always be the primary goal of an advertiser or specifically one who is just beginning to get their name out in front of prospects.  

##2.  Reach   

Display advertising allows advertisers to reach a wider audience, as it can be displayed on a variety of websites and platforms, even on competitor websites that rely on display advertising. This can include popular social media sites, news websites, and blogs. Search advertising, is typically limited to search engine results pages, which may not reach as wide of an audience especially if your ads compete on expensive keywords through Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising.

## 3.  Flexibility

Using display ads can offer flexibility in terms of ad format, as advertisers can choose from text, image, and video ads on where they are placed. Advertisers can create more engaging and creative ads to capture the attention of potential customers. Search advertising is typically limited to text-based ads and the reliance of meta tags for a given URL.

## 4.  Demographics and Interests  
Display advertising allows advertisers to target specific demographics and interests. This means that ads can be shown to users who are more likely to be interested in the products or services being advertised. Search advertising, on the other hand, primarily targets users based on specific keywords and phrases, which may not always align with a user's demographics or interests.

## 5.  Remarketing   

Display advertising allows for remarketing, which is the process of targeting users who have previously interacted with an advertiser's website or ads. This allows advertisers to reach users who are more likely to convert, as they have already shown an interest in the advertiser's products or services. Search advertising also allows for remarketing, but the targeting may not be as specific as display advertising.  

## 6.  Cost-effective   

Display advertising can be cost-effective, as advertisers can choose to pay for ad impressions or clicks, and can set a budget for their campaign. Search advertising can also be cost-effective, but advertisers may have to pay for ad impressions regardless of whether they lead to a conversion.

## 7.  Ad formats   
Display advertising allows for a variety of ad formats, such as banners, interstitials, videos, and more. This can make the ads more interactive, engaging and can increase the chances of users interacting with them. Search ads are usually limited to a few lines of text, which may not be as engaging.

## Display over Search Advertising  

In conclusion, Display advertising offers a number of benefits over search advertising that can make it effective for branding, allows for a wider reach, offers flexibility in terms of ad format, targets specific demographics and interests, enables remarketing, can be cost-effective and permits a variety of ad formats.   
> These benefits make display advertising a suitable option for advertisers who want to increase brand awareness, reach a wider audience and create engaging ads.   

However, it's important to note that both search and display advertising have their own set of benefits and can be used to achieve different marketing goals. Advertisers should consider their specific goals and target audience before choosing the most effective strategy.
