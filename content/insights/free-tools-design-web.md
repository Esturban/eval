> The more time-saving resources you have, the easier it is for you to work on your business.    

Tools such as AI assistants will save time for routine tasks like copywriting or finding resources
for images and content.  Any tools EV Advisory comes across that helps complete the job quicker,
better and more efficiently without sacrificing quality is worth saving and reusing. Here is a first
post in a series of tools available online we will be sharing.

### Website Performance :toolbox:  

Website performance is a multi-faceted measure determining the speed at which websites respond to users and whether or not
the site fulfills the needs of the user. The web performance measures include the time it takes to load web pages, the
number of seconds it takes to load each page, and how long it takes for the browser to respond when you click on a link,
button or other UI.

The tools below help identify where you may have shortcomings on your website and where you can
improve your web presence:   

1) [Google’s Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en) - A chrome
extension that is used to benchmark how a website performs by speed, accessibility, SEO and other metrics that effect your
rank overall. If you use the extension sparingly for your site and your site’s pages, you’ll never have to pay a dime for running
the extension.  

2) [GT Metrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)- A website that conducts a benchmark of your website using the Lighthouse methods
