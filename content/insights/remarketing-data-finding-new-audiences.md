Remarketing data is a powerful practice for businesses looking to expand their customer base and increase their ROI. It allows companies to target specific groups of people who have previously interacted with their brand, whether through visiting their website, engaging with their social media accounts, or clicking on an ad. By understanding who these people are and what they are interested in, businesses can create highly effective marketing campaigns that will reach their target audience and drive conversions.

## Target Audience Potential :busts_in_silhouette:  

Personas and target audiences are key components of any remarketing strategy.   

> A persona is a fictional representation of an ideal customer, based on demographics, interests, and behavior.   
   
> A target audience is a specific group of people that a business is trying to reach, typically defined by demographics, location, and interests.   

Creating personas and target audiences, businesses can ensure that their marketing efforts are reaching the right people, rather than wasting their budget on ineffective advertising.  

One of the most important questions to ask when developing a remarketing strategy is:   


> where is my target audience 'hanging out'?   

The answer to this question will vary depending on the industry, but there are a few key places to look.   

If a business is **targeting young professionals**, they may want to focus their efforts on LinkedIn and Instagram, as these platforms are popular among this demographic.   

On the other hand, if a business is **targeting parents**, they may want to focus on Facebook and Pinterest, as these platforms are popular among this demographic.  

In the event you have alternative blogs or more niche sites you're looking for finding your potential audience or extending your customer reach, consider a similar site lookup directory such as [Site Like Website Search](https://www.sitelike.org/)  

## Find New Customers Through Data Analysis  

One of the best ways to find new customers is through remarketing data taken from advertising platforms. When you're using an advertising platform like Google Ads or Facebook Ads, you can actually see a bit of information about who the people are who interact most with your platform.   

> Remarketing data is information about the people who have interacted with a business's ads, including their demographics, interests, and behavior.    

As you begin marketing digitally, you'll receive results of data that provides you insights about the demographics that respond well to your advertising. By analyzing this data, businesses can identify patterns and trends that can help them create highly effective marketing campaigns that will reach their target audience and drive conversions.  

> If a business is running a campaign on Facebook and they notice that a large number of their conversions are coming from people who live in a specific city, they can create a custom audience of people who live in that city and target them with ads that are tailored to their interests and behavior.   

Similarly, if a business notices that a large number of their conversions are coming from people who are interested in a specific topic, they can create a custom audience of people who are interested in that topic and target them with ads that are tailored to their interests.  

## The Benefits of Retargeting   
  
Another way to find new customers is through retargeting.  
 > Retargeting is a form of remarketing that allows businesses to target people who have previously interacted with their brand, whether through visiting their website, engaging with their social media accounts, or clicking on an ad.   
   

 By targeting these people with ads that are tailored to their interests and behavior, businesses can increase their chances of converting them into customers.  
   


In the event that a business is running a campaign on Facebook and they notice that a large number of people are visiting their website but not making a purchase, they can create a custom audience of people who have visited their website and target them with ads that encourage them to make a purchase. Similarly, if a business is running a campaign on Instagram and they notice that a large number of people are engaging with their posts but not making a purchase, they can create a custom audience of people who have engaged with their posts and target them with ads that encourage them to make a purchase.
