## What are Meta Tags and Why Are They Important for SEO? :shushing_face:   


Meta tags are snippets of text that provide search engines with information about a website or page. They are an essential
part of SEO as they help search engines understand the content of a webpage and determine how it should be indexed and
ranked for search engine users to find you. Here’s an example of where you’ve likely seen these meta tags being used to
help you find things like *digital marketing*

> Meta tags are used to create organic outreach opportunities by appearing in search engine results pages (SERPs) as well
as SEM campaigns almost providing free advertising billboard space when someone is looking for a product or service online.    


When optimizing meta tags, businesses can increase their visibility in SERPs and drive more organic traffic to their website
as search engines use this information to categorize your page. For more information about how a search engine categorizes
your content, check out our post about how you’re categorized.


### How to Use Meta Tags & Search Engine Assets to Improve Your Organic Reach :chart_increasing:   

Meta tags are pieces of HTML code that are included in the header of an HTML webpage as a first line of categorizing and
defining a web page. A search engine tends to crawl and index these pieces as the items to show in SERPs. Depending on
your website builder, these items might be defined as follows:   
- Manually updating the content for each of the pages    
- The first lines of the page’s content    
- Variables set by the builder to share the assets    

There’s a long list of meta tags that help your site, but it’s usually an exercise in finding out how your audience
speaks and the language someone looking for your page will use. To see the options available, we can use a real
example such as Instagram.

*Instagram has only a few meta tags that they use*, but a long list of alternative links that they accommodate so that users
who share these pages across different devices have a seamless experience in Meta applications such as Whatsapp or Facebook.  


### Important Meta Tags Necessary for Effective SEO  

Given their utility, there are tons of tags for different purposes, but we will highlight here the most important
meta tags for most use cases that encompass product or services websites. Here’s a list of the meta tags useful
for getting you started:  

- Title tag - `<title></title>` - The first anchor your visitors will see from organic search results  
- Meta Description - `<meta name=”description” content=”…”/>` - A field used in the description of your page to
reflect the contents when visitors find you via organic search or your link is shared  
- Heading tags - `<h#></h#>` - Although it doesn’t directly affect search results, it helps search engines
like google categorize your content quickly and find whether or not your sections directly answer common
questions users have  
- Image Alt tags - `<img alt = “…”/>` - Search engines can’t see images and this tells them if your content is fitting
- Schema Markup - `<html itemtype = “[schema type]”></html>` - An extensive topic, but one worth reviewing to
understand how schemas can further categorize your content and put them in the appropriate format for readers
who search for specific service or product categories  
- Social Media Tags - `<meta name=”og:…”/>` - The open graph protocols used for sharing social media elements of
your page conveniently when your link is shared. There are several fields that are available and for more information
you can visit https://ogp.me/ to understand how the arrays and the objects are defined.  


Although it’s a section of your website that your users can’t see, it’s an important part of your anatomy
like your organs and bones that are under flesh but, are necessary to walk or breathe. Take care of your website’s
anatomy with meta tags that are important to your audience so that they can find you in common search engines.
