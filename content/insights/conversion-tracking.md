Are you looking to increase conversions for your online business? Conversion tracking
can be a powerful tool in helping you reach your goals. But what exactly is conversion
tracking and how do you use it to your advantage? This article explores the basics
of conversion tracking and how you can use it to improve your online business.    

## What is Conversion Tracking? :heavy_dollar_sign:     

Conversion tracking is a way to measure the success of your online business and
marketing efforts. Conversion is among the most important aspects of running
an online business or website, as it allows you to better understand how your
visitors and customers behave as well as helping you track the success of
your strategies with visitors. Knowing how many visitors are taking the
desired action on your website is crucial for ensuring your business gets the
maximum benefit from its web presence. To learn more about [establishing web presence,
check out our 5 step guide]({{<relref "insights/web-presence">}} "Help Establish Web Presence (5 Step Guide)")    

Conversion is mistakenly seen as only making a purchase on the website. However,
a conversion can take several forms such as:  
- Email Subscription - Did a visitor subscribe to our email program? :e-mail:  
- Purchase - Did a visitor make a purchase?  
- Schedule Demo - Did a visitor schedule a demo? :clock:  
- Discounts - Did a visitor use a discount?  
- Downloads - Did a visitor download a resource? :inbox_tray:    
- Add Products - Did a visitor add a product to a basket?  
- Video Views - Did a visitor view a video? :video_camera:   
- Social Follow - Did a visitor visit our social or follow us?   
- Donations - Did a visitor donate to a featured charity?   

This is a general list across businesses, but this can be defined differently
depending on the company or website in which it is formed. A blog will have different
goals for defining a "conversion" vs. an e-commerce business selling water bottles.

Tracking conversions through services like Facebook's pixel or Google's tag allows
you to track which sources are bringing in the most customers or leads, so you can
focus on those areas for further optimization. Conversion tracking happens through:   

- **Calls to action** - Are clients taking a desired action we are prompting?  
- **Customer journey steps** - Are clients purchasing after performing a set of actions?   
- **Purchases or Subscriptions** - Is my initiative successfully reaching the goal?  

Investing in advertising or tweaking a website design may be the key to
improving your online business performance. Tracking conversions is the first step
in determining where adjustments likely need to be made for websites or campaigns.

duration and bounce rate can give you clarity on how customers are interacting
with your website.

up a data-driven marketing strategy that you can measure whether or not it's
in your company's best interest.

## Strategies to Integrate Conversion Tracking :thinking_face:   

There are a few tools available that can help you determine if your business
is converting as you expect. Here they are:

- Google Analytics - With Google Tag Manager, you can tag website elements to track calls to action
and other important metrics that can help you identify which initiatives are working and which are not. :chart_increasing:   
- Mixpanel - An analytics tools that tracks events thoroughly so you can pass information to Email Service
Providers (ESPs) for different campaigns for customers in their journey.   
- Facebook Pixel - Determine which clients are finding your site and content from Meta Ads on
Instagram, Facebook and Whatsapp. :camera:    
- Hotjar - Determine common paths visitors to your page use to find the information they need
and where they are getting stuck (Bounce / Non-engagement)  

### Customer Journey :person:  
By understanding the customer journey, you can craft and adjust calls to action
that are specific to each user's needs and interests. With data provided by the
tools noted above, you can determine what type of content resonates with your
target audience and apply this knowledge to improve digital marketing campaigns.  
User intent is the most important aspect of search engine categorization.

### A/B Testing :test_tube:   
You can also use A/B testing to compare different versions of a page or UI element to
determine which changes yield the best results. This could take the form of:  
- Color adjustments - Does a certain theme or color scheme perform better with customers?   
- Sizing - Do different sizes resonate better with clients? Bigger or smaller headings, images, or general fonts?  
- Messaging - Are there words that perform better with clients?  

Here are only a few items in A/B testing mentioned, but the variations can
be almost endless until you find the optima.  
> A/B testing helps you see what is working and what needs
to be adjusted in order to achieve the desired results from customers.    

From calls-to-action to page layouts, A/B testing allows you to
make informed decisions about what will help increase conversions for your business.  

### Desktop and Mobile Optimized :mobile_phone:    
Making sure to optimize webpages for both desktop and mobile is also essential
in order to capture more conversions.  Unless your site is accessed 100% by
mobile or by desktop (which is something that Google Analytics or Mixpanel can tell you),
you likely have a variety of visitors from different devices and different browsers
finding your page and purchasing. Adapting to the clients' needs is evidently
necessary so when they visit they are not deterred by the interface that wasn't
adjusted for their needs on mobile or desktop. In your browser, try inspecting and
seeing the different devices on which your site would likely be loaded to see
if the design remains as pleasant as it does on your common website development
environment.    


## Measuring Marketing Channel Performance by Conversion     

Now that you have conversion tracking like Google Tags or Facebook Pixel on your site,
you can determine which channels work best for your business as customers convert. The
trackers would tell you a bit of the following:  
- Which was the last page a client was on before purchasing or converting  
- How many steps were taken to purchase  
- Whether or not bounces were seen from a given audience   
- Whether or not visitors are interacting with an advertisement   

Although they won't give you specific reasons as to why an action was taken,
these tools can narrow down areas in which a client takes an action so that
experiments can infer the reason for a specific action.   

**For example**  

**Hypothesis:** Most of our business comes from clients who are following us on TikTok  

**Experiment:** Tracking first page referrers and where they come from **who convert**.  

Seeing where they come from my tell you that they are the highest converters, but they could
just as likely be the highest converters and the highest bouncers as well.   

If your page is mostly featured on a single platform like TikTok, this may skew
your results into believing that TikTok is the only platform worth advertising on.
