## Helping your website drive value to your clients so your business may thrive


In this digital age, it is no longer a luxury to have an online presence; it's a requirement.
Your website has become your storefront, and your customers expect to be able to find what they need with a single click.  
At EV Advisory, we know the importance of first impressions in terms of user-focused design and user experience.
If your website is left unattended, you may be leaving money on the table with visitors who don’t tell you about the
problems you might have.  

### Making search engines your website’s friends

Search engine optimization (SEO) is a way to make your website’s information more accessible to
search engines and the people who use them. The first step in optimizing your website for search
engines is to conduct regular audits of the assets used. As websites are interconnected today with
other apps or widgets losing coverage (e.g. stop using an app or it is no longer maintained) can
have a fatal hit on your website’s score.  

### Performance- and Test-Driven Development

Performance-driven or test-driven development (PD/TD) is a software engineering process that puts
testing and performance first for a product. Like any software development, PD is composed of three
sections - planning, coding and testing:    

- EV Advisory plans a clear idea of what the software should do and how it should appear anchoring
on performance-based practices for your website     

- Coding is then done to fit the requirements of the plan to avoid reworking the product.  

- Testing ensures that the software performs as expected every time it's run, providing early
detection of problems before they happen.   

However, with PD, quality assurance (QA) is the primary focus throughout the process of
website creation or optimization to ensure you receive a valuable service that helps you and
your visitors. The most time consuming of these stages is the comprehensive testing of the
product which takes the form of:   

-  **Network Analysis** - *Determine how resources are being downloaded from the website*  
- **SEO Audit** - *Find out if the right audience is finding you*   
- **Deployment environments** - *How we roll out changes without taking effect on the production page*  
- **Performance first** - *Benchmarks, benchmarks, benchmarks*  
- **Tradeoffs in design** - *Is the pretty “asset” really a contra-asset?*  

These are a few of the persistent considerations in the development of web pages from scratch
and similarly for pre-existing pages that want an organic boost in performance.

### Online Presence in the Information Era

Businesses need to have an online presence in today’s digital era because people are looking
for information on the internet before making any purchase decisions.  Instead of leaving your
website’s fate up to chance with visitors’ search, bring relief to your digital storefront to
make buying from you irrefutable.
