## Marketing: a delicate art and science

One of the most important things you can do in marketing is to know who your audience is
and why they need the problem you solve. About your audience:  
- What is the size of their network?  
- What are their interests? How do they speak?  
- What do they struggle with most? 

Knowing the size and interests of your targeted audience determines what kind of
content appeals to them most, what marketing methods you use, and where you advertise.
Interviewing clients can be a long process with few useful conclusions without the
appropriate structure.  A client-first approach in marketing allows you to more easily
relate to customers’ needs. Modern data collection can now bring relief to these
situations by inferring reason from behavior to leverage data-driven marketing insights.    

### How Does Data-Driven Marketing Help Scale and Grow Your Business

Data-driven marketing is the process of using data to drive decisions used by marketers
with the help of analytics. Businesses can scale and grow by increasing conversion rates
and improving advertising spend allocation. By collecting, analyzing and interpreting
data from various sources like social media, search engines, customer’s behavior etc.,
your company could reduce the expenses in areas that do not help the business prosper.
This is how companies like Skims and Gymshark can compete with Lululemon or Tesla with Toyota.   

### The Key to Using Data-Driven Marketing for Successful Results

With data-driven marketing, the more you know about your audience, the more you can tailor your
message to their needs. A few important areas of focus in marketing your online business are:  

- A/B testing - a critical component allowing companies to determine which version of their
website or messaging resonates most with their target audience.   
- SEO - Identifying the right voice of your clients and how they look for you.   
- Content Strategy - Finding the tone your visitors speak in so they may relate.  
- Marketing Channels - Looking for your customers and prospects in the right places.  

These key areas of focus for a data-driven marketing strategy can set your business apart
from that of the competition. Instead of relying on the next hottest social media platform
to drive your advertising spend, we find your network of clients and the right approach for you.
